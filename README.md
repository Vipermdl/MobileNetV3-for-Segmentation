# MobileNetV3-for-Segmentation

#### It is a repository that re-implementing MobileNet-V3 for semantic segmentation on cityscapes with pytorch. The repository is unfinished because the results on val cityscapes dataset only have 58% Miou, which is unsatisfactory definitly. I will fix the gap between mine with original paper result.
